Overview

This project is a fun Python program that randomly generates fake news-style headlines by combining random subjects, actions, and locations/things.

Every time you run the program (or type “yes”), it creates a new and hilarious headline — perfect for humor, learning, and Python practice.
How It Works

The program stores lists of subjects, actions, and locations/things.

It uses Python’s random.choice() to pick one from each list.

Combines them into a fake headline.

Keeps generating new headlines until the user types no.
